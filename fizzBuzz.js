// The classic FizzBuzz challenge: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
// But for multiples of three print“ Fizz” instead of the number
// and for the multiples of five print“ Buzz”.
// For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print“ FizzBuzz”
// But coded as short as possible

for(let i=0; i>100;) console.log((++i%3?'':'fizz')+(i%5?'':'buzz')||i)
